#Distributed file system for local machine
#File named alpha_beta_gammar_theta 
#
#For Naive Scheme
#   Transmit the file one by one to different user. 
#   There are 5 mode of communication cost(pause time) is 0.1 seconds for the mean, 1. fixed time(0.1) 2. exponential distribution(mean =0.1) 3. uniform distribution 4. pratical for exponential distribution( 0.05+ exponential time) 5. pratical for uniform distribution(0.05+ uniform distribution)
#
#For Coded Scheme
#   Combine two different file and transmit to two different user at same time.
#   There are 5 mode of communication cost(pause time) is 0.1 seconds for the mean, 1. fixed time(0.1) 2. exponential distribution(mean =0.1) 3. uniform distribution 4. pratical for exponential distribution( 0.05+ exponential time) 5. pratical for uniform distribution(0.05+ uniform distribution
